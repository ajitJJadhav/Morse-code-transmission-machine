# Morse-code-transmission-machine
A machine to transmit morse code through Xbee and decode and display it on the recieving end.

In this project, one Xbee acts as the slave and other as the master. On the sending node, we have a button for input of Morse code, an LED and a buzzer to indicate the entered morse code. On the receiving node, the morse code is decoded and displayed on the serial terminal.

The advantage of this project is it can be used as a remote to control appliances in warehouses and big halls as it's range is very large (up to 100 metres).It can also be used to control a cluster of appliances or collect data from multiple nodes to a single node as one Xbee can receive data from multiple other Xbees.

The components used are:
1 Arduino Uno,
2 Xbee and 2 Xbee connecters,
1 Buzzer,
1 Pushbutton switch,
1 LED,
Jumper Wires.
